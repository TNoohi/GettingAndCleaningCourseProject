# Code book for Coursera *Getting and Cleaning Data* course project

The data set that this code book pertains to is located in the `Finaldata.txt` file of this repository.

See the `README.md` file of this repository for background information on this data set.

The structure of the data set is described in the [Data](#data) section, its variables are listed in the [Variables](#variables) section, and the transformations that were carried out to obtain the data set based on the source data are presented in the [Transformations](#transformations) section.

## Data <a name="data"></a>

The `Finaldata.txt` data file is a text file, containing space-separated values.

The first row contains the names of the variables, which are listed and described in the [Variables](#variables) section, and the following rows contain the values of these variables. 

## Variables <a name="variables"></a>

Each row contains, for a given subject and activity, 79 averaged signal measurements.

### Identifiers <a name="identifiers"></a>

- `subject`

	Subject identifier, integer, ranges from 1 to 30.

- `activity`

	Activity identifier, string with 6 possible values: 
	- `WALKING`: subject was walking
	- `WALKING_UPSTAIRS`: subject was walking upstairs
	- `WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS`: subject was walking downstairs
	- `SITTING`: subject was sitting
	- `STANDING`: subject was standing
	- `LAYING`: subject was laying

### Average of measurements <a name="average-measurements"></a>

All measurements are floating-point values, normalised and bounded within [-1,1].

Prior to normalisation, acceleration measurements (variables containing `Accelerometer`) were made in *g*'s (9.81 m.s⁻²) and gyroscope measurements (variables containing `Gyroscope`) were made in radians per second (rad.s⁻¹).

Magnitudes of three-dimensional signals (variables containing `Magnitude`) were calculated using the Euclidean norm.

The measurements are classified in two domains:

- Time-domain signals (variables prefixed by `timeDomain`), resulting from the capture of accelerometer and gyroscope raw signals.

- Frequency-domain signals (variables prefixed by `frequencyDomain`), resulting from the application of a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to some of the time-domain signals.

## Transformations <a name="transformations"></a>

The zip file containing the source data is located at [https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip).
run_analysis.R follows the 5 steps required as described in the course project’s definition

1. Download the dataset
		Dataset downloaded and extracted under the folder called UCI HAR Dataset

2. Assign each data to variables

	features <- features.txt 
	
	activities <- activity_labels.txt
	
	subject_test <- test/subject_test.txt 
	
	x_test <- test/X_test.txt 
	
	y_test <- test/y_test.txt 
	
	subject_train <- test/subject_train.txt 
	
	x_train <- test/X_train.txt 
	
	y_train <- test/y_train.txt 


3. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set

	X (10299 rows, 561 columns) is created by merging x_train and x_test using rbind() function
	
	Y (10299 rows, 1 column) is created by merging y_train and y_test using rbind() function
	
	Subject (10299 rows, 1 column) is created by merging subject_train and subject_test using rbind() function
	
	All_Data (10299 rows, 563 column) is created by merging Subject, Y and X using cbind() function

4. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement

	subSetData (10299 rows, 88 columns) is created by subsetting All_Data, selecting only columns: subject, code and the measurements on the mean and standard deviation (std) for each measurement

5.  Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

	- Entire numbers in code column of the subSetData replaced with corresponding activity taken from second column of the activities variable

6.  Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names

		1 . code column in subSetData renamed into activities

		2. All word strats with capital letter

		3. Words are separated by "_" to make them easier to read

		4. All Acc in column’s name replaced by Accelerometer

		5. All Gyro in column’s name replaced by Gyroscope

		6. All BodyBody in column’s name replaced by Body

		7. All Mag in column’s name replaced by Magnitude

		8. All start with character f in column’s name replaced by Frequency

		9. All start with character t in column’s name replaced by Time


	-Code:
	
names(subSetData)[1] = "Subject"

names(subSetData)[2] = "Activity"

names(subSetData)<-gsub("Acc", "_Accelerometer", names(subSetData))

names(subSetData)<-gsub("Gyro", "_Gyroscope", names(subSetData))

names(subSetData)<-gsub("BodyBody|Body", "_Body", names(subSetData))

names(subSetData)<-gsub("Mag", "_Magnitude", names(subSetData))

names(subSetData)<-gsub("^t", "Time", names(subSetData))

names(subSetData)<-gsub("\\.t", "_Time", names(subSetData))

names(subSetData)<-gsub("tBody", "Time_Body", names(subSetData))

names(subSetData)<-gsub("[Mm]ean|\\.[Mm]ean|\\.[Mm]ean(\\.*){2,3}", "_Mean", names(subSetData))

names(subSetData)<-gsub("std|\\.std|\\.std(\\.*){2,3}", "_STD", names(subSetData))

names(subSetData)<-gsub("[Ff]req|\\.[Ff]req|[Ff]req(\\.*){2,3}", "_Frequency", names(subSetData))

names(subSetData)<-gsub("^f", "Frequency", names(subSetData))

names(subSetData)<-gsub("angle", "Angle", names(subSetData))

names(subSetData)<-gsub("(\\.*){0,2}[Gg]ravity", "_Gravity", names(subSetData))

names(subSetData)<-gsub("Jerk", "_Jerk", names(subSetData))

names(subSetData)<-gsub("(\\.*){0,3}X", "_X", names(subSetData))

names(subSetData)<-gsub("(\\.*){0,3}Y", "_Y", names(subSetData))

names(subSetData)<-gsub("(\\.*){0,3}Z", "_Z", names(subSetData))


7. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

	FinalData (180 rows, 88 columns) is created by sumarizing subSetData taking the means of each variable for each activity and each subject, after groupped by subject and activity.
	
	Export FinalData into FinalData.txt file.
